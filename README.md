# simulating-multitasking-agent

I build a dynamic structural model of a multitasking sale agent and simulate the model.
A sales agent puts her efforts on two tasks: making sales and recruiting her team members.
She got rewarded based on her sales output and the number of team members whom she successfully recruited.

The details of model is included in power point slide (Simulation Results.pptx).
